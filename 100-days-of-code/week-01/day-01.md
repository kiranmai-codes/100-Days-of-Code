- âœ… What I did today: Concepts in Array - created a list of problems to solve on leetcode and GFG. 

link to leetcode(Arrays): https://leetcode.com/problem-list/2sk4qz9t/
GFG: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/first-negative-integer-every-window-size-k/
     https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/equilibrium-index-of-an-array/
     https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inversion-count-in-array-using-merge-sort/

- ðŸ“š What I learned: Theory - Array Indexing, Looping, In place algorthim, Sorting Algorthims, Two Pointer Technique, Sliding window - fixed,variable size, prefix sum, kadane's algorthim, search algorthims, bit manipulation, 2d arrays

Learned all the theortical and implementation on these things work by manually dry running code.

- ðŸ”œ Plan for tomorrow: Start Problems solving problems on leetcode on the topics above.
